        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Welcome to BR DAV Public School, a school that that promotes sound values, self-discipline, motivation and excellence. We strongly believe that every child is a winner and must be cherished and nurtured with utmost gentleness and understanding. We are convinced that each child is unique and must be given the opportunity to wonder, explore, think, create, express and bloom. With us, children grow together in a world of joy and fun-filled learning. Together, they learn, share, face and fight the challenges and travails of childhood as they transit to adult years. Gradually they are equipped with knowledge and 21st century skills that will hold them in good stead all their lives even while they remain rooted in culture, heritage and values. So the aim which we had planned is to ensure that all students must take part in academics sporting, culture, and have encountered all high expectations of co-operation, enthusiasm, conduct, tolerance, consideration for others till high motivation. Our scholastic record is excellent and we are equally proud of our outstanding record of non-scholastic activities. We are proud of our infrastructure facilities, our team of dedicated professionals and an array of co-curricular activities. We are also focused on building principle-centered lives, where courtesy, respect, human dignity, services and quality, make our school different. Core values are embedded in BR DAV uniquely, integrated and exciting curriculum which constantly stimulates the young minds. These values are the guiding light in our entire personal, professional and curriculum transactions. Most importantly, we realize that learning is an exciting journey travelled together by the child, the parent and the school. We are very thankful to our parental body, Chairman Shri S.S. Raghav GM(HR) and other senior Principals. Under their able guidance, we achieved many goals. I am thankful to our society representatives, parents, our office and menial staff for ensuring us the success in every field. I specially want to thank my efficient teaching staff, editorial board, printers and everyone who supported directly or indirectly.

            BR DAV is a Branch of the DAV Public School. It was started by ND Grover.The DAV institutuions are a gift of the Arya Samaj, a progressive movement founded by Swami Dayanand Sarawati in 1875. With a view to bringing about a balanced and harmonious development of the future citizens of this country and to infuse in them the ideals of the Vedic Culture and a high sense of patrotism, Aray Samaj founded a School at Lahore in 1886 by the name of Dayanand Anglo Vedic School headed by Mahatma Hansraj who derved as first Principal of the institution gratis. The DAV Schools provide a congenial environment for the all round development of a child to build amicable personality coupled with integrity of character and depth of knowledge, which is a feature of 'Indianness'.
